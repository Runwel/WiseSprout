First, it contains a balanced mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are essential nutrients for plant growth. Second, it is a slow-release fertilizer, which means that it provides nutrients to plants over a long period of time. This helps to prevent over-fertilization and reduces the risk of burning plants. Third, the fertilizer is gentle and does not harm young seedlings. Fourth, it is highly absorbent, which means that plants can easily take up the nutrients they need. Finally, the fertilizer is suitable for all types of plants, including vegetables, fruits, flowers, and trees.\r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n\r\nBasis application: mix fertilizer and soil evenly\r\nTopdressing: It is better to bury the fertilizer evenly and shallowly in the soil.\r\nThe recommended application cycle is 120 days\r\nGentle Reminder:\r\n\r\nWhile the Yudongli fertilizer is gentle and safe for plants, it is important to use it properly to avoid over-fertilization. Too much fertilizer can harm plants and cause them to grow too quickly, which can make them more susceptible to pests and diseases. Be sure to follow the instructions on the package and use the recommended amount of fertilizer for your plants.
